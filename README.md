This workshop has been set up to practice testing in Rails. We deliberately set this up without tests for people to practice implementing RSpec, MiniTest, or your testing library of choice. This project uses Rails 5.0.2, and has some gems added to the Gemfile that we use for testing, including fabrication, RSpec, database_cleaner, launchy, and shoulda-matchers.
